**Number of Good Pairs**
*
**Brute force approach:**
* Use concatinated for loop and within that compare two indices.
*
**Optimise approach:**
* Initialize counter array size is given as per constraints.
* Incrementing counter array as per array indices.
* Apply sum of n-1 number series {1,2,3,....n-1} formula.
* Incrementing counter with iterating result.
* Returing a counter as good pair in numbers
